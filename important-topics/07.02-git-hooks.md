# Git Hooks

A Git hook is a script that Git automatically runs when certain events occur in a repository ‚Äî for example, before you make a commit or after you push.
They allow you to customize Git‚Äôs behavior and automate workflows like code formatting, linting, or deployment.

# Use Cases

- Run ESLint and Prettier before commits
- Block pushes if unit tests fail
- Can block if `any` typescript
- Validate contributor license agreements
- Auto-fill commit templates

# How?

- find `.git/hooks` folder
- rename `.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- logic in scripting language in `pre-commit` file
- `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` run in bash

Example Logic:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "üîç Checking for DEBUG statements..."

# Get list of staged files
files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

for file in $files; do
  if grep -q "DEBUG" "$file"; then
    echo "‚ùå DEBUG found in $file. Commit blocked."
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "‚úÖ No DEBUG statements found. Proceeding with commit."
exit 0
```

- **Problem**: when you push and then clone the hooks not found because git not track the `.git/hooks` directory. manually setup (store the folder and readme file).
- **Solution**: Hook Manager like **Husky**
