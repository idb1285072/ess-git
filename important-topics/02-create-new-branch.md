```

# Switch remote branch

```bash
git fetch origin #fetch all remote branch
git branch -r #see exiting remote branches

TODO

## Recovering deleted branch or lost commits

If you delete a branch but the commits are still referenced in reflog:

```bash
git reflog
# find SHA of last commit on branch
git checkout -b recovered-branch <sha>
```

`git reflog` is your friend â€” it tracks local HEAD movements.
