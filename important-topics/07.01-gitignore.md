- `.gitignore` is a text file
- file or directive to ignore (not track or commit)

## Patterns

- `*.log` ignore all `.log` files
- `build/` ignore the build directory and all its contents
- `/config.yml` ignore `config.yml` only in the root, not subdirectories
- `!important.log` exclude from ignore — track `important.log` even if `*.log` is ignored
- `**/temp` ignore temp directories anywhere in repo

## Rules
- Order matters: later rules override earlier ones
- Comments start with `#`
- Can have multiple `.gitignore` files
- Patterns are related to `.gitignore` location
- If a file is already committed, adding it to .gitignore won’t remove it. To stop tracking `git rm --cached file.txt`
