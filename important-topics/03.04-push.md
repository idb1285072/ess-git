```bash
git push origin main
git push -u origin feature/login # push new branch and --set-upstream
git push --all origin # push every local branch to remote
git push origin --delete feature/login # delete remote branch
git push upstream dev # push dev branch to upstream remote
```

**Note**: `git push` push local main branch to remote main branch because at the beginning when create new repo we command `git push -u origin main`. It create an upstream local main branch to remote main branch. Otherwise, every time we need to command `git push origin main` instead of `git push`.

# Summary

So,

```bash
# frist time
git checkout feature/login
git push -u origin feature/login

# then
git checkout feature/login
git push
```

or,

```bash
# everytime
git checkout feature/login
git push origin feature/login
```
